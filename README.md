# Send an Email or SMS from a website

This is an application I made in order to gain a deeper undersating of cloud services and how serverless architecture interacts.
This program allows a user to write a message and send it to a desired email or SMS using AWS services. The site is hosted via an S3 bucket and makes use of Lambda with functions written in Python to trigger events in SNS and SES



AWS Services Used:
 - S3
 - API Gateway
 - Lambda
 - Step Functions
 - SES
 - SNS
